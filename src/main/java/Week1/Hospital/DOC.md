# Inheritance and Abstract Classes in OOP: A Summary
In the realm of object-oriented programming (OOP), 
the concepts of inheritance and abstract classes hold 
significant relevance in the structural and 
organizational aspects of code.

## Purpose
Inheritance establishes an "is-a" relationship, 
where a subclass inherits properties and behaviours 
from a parent class, thereby facilitating code reuse. 
On the other hand, abstract classes provide a standardized 
blueprint for related classes, ensuring the implementation 
of certain methods in subclasses.

## Instantiation
Inheritance allows the instantiation of both parent and 
child classes. Conversely, abstract classes cannot be 
instantiated directly; only concrete subclasses have 
this capability.

## Implementation
Inheritance entails the inheritance of all attributes and 
methods from the parent class, affording the option to add 
or override them in the subclass. Abstract classes encompass
both abstract (without implementation) and concrete (implemented) 
methods, mandating that subclasses implement all abstract methods.

## Use Cases
Inheritance is well-suited for establishing class hierarchies, 
exemplified by the scenario of a Vehicle as a parent class with 
Car and Motorcycle as subclasses. Abstract classes find utility 
in ensuring the implementation of specific methods in subclasses 
while furnishing shared functionality, as exemplified by the Shape
class featuring an abstract calculateArea() method.

In summary, inheritance promotes code reuse and specialization, 
whereas abstract classes delineate a framework ensuring specific 
implementations within subclasses. Both concepts are integral
to the development of structured, sustainable, and adaptable OOP code.
